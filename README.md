<h1 align='center'>Dune</h1>

A micro-project I built to better understand **cellular automata** and experiment with basic **graph algorithms** (although the core logic for a sand simulation is fairly straightforward).

## Todo List

This is a list of things I want to further explore with such a simulation

- [ ] A working sand hourglass with a custom timer
- [ ] Explore more simulations like **fire propagation** or **ant colony behavior**
- [ ] Explore with infinite grid
- [ ] Add time based traces in game of life
- [ ] Add pre-defined patterns in game of life
- [ ] Ride Shai-Hulud xD.
- [x] Fix gravity, since currently everything just falls at the same time
- [x] **Conway's Game of Life** automaton
